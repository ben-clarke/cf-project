              <p>I decided that I wanted to become a developer a few years ago.</p>
              <p>It started back in High School while I did a BTEC Diploma and we started HTML // CSS basics using Dreamweaver, fast forward as the summer break was coming up I decided to learn HTML and CSS during the summer.</p>
              <p>I continued coding throughout school, college and now I'm looking to do it full-time either as a full-time job or as a freelancer.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
              <p>When I receive a email from a potential client or a existing client, the email usually provides what they want first off (which is great). What I do first off is that I contact the client with a few ideas and opinions regarding the project.</p>
              <p>Next I contact the client regarding the costs of the project, obviously this depends on the project, however I send a final brief of the project, to the client, after this the client will then decide whether it is cost effective for them and whether they want to go ahead with the project.</p>
              <p>After the go ahead I get to work, creating a design (if needed) if the client does not require a re-design and already has one I of course gets this sent to be. I get started on the website straight away and chip away until the site is done (This could take anywhere from 2 weeks to a 1 month) but again this depemds on the project. Throughout the design / development process I of course update the client every step of the way and answer any questions they have.</p>
              <p>After I am happy with the site I then get to test the site, check for bugs, spelling etc and fix accordingly.</p>
              <p>After this I email the client that the site is complete and put the site on a test domain (usually on heroku), after I get the check that the client is happy and I get the go ahead to go live, I upload the website to my own deployment server and change the DNS for the domain accordingly. I provide the client with support, updates etc even after the site has gone live.</p>
