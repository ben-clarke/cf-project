          <h3>More About Me</h3>
          <p>I am 20 years old.<p>
          <br>
          <p>I started creating websites or rather learning how they work in 2008 after I just felt that it was something that I was interested in and therefore started learning what I can, so that’s exactly what I did I started off with HTML and CSS to begin with and I really enjoyed learning it, I researched on new techniques/methods etc. I started to find free templates online and downloaded them to learn more, I would open them up dreamweaver and take bits of code out to see what it did and why, I did this for a while. I got really involved with IT whilst at school and got to knew my teachers well, so as the years passed, I started to focus on IT more than web but still try and do both, so I decided to take a level 2 BTEC Diploma whilst at school to further my education in IT and web, I passed with flying colours but I didn’t want to stop there I went on to do a another diploma this time Level 3 at South and City College Birmingham after this I went on to do a Graphic and Web Diploma at clevercherry which are based in the Jewellery Quarter.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I then, after the diploma at clevercherry, got at job at Succeed, which are again based in the jewellery quarter and I have been there until late February 2015 to where I was made redundant.</p>
